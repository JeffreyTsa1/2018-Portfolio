                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Hourglass is the result of a semester-long group project for CS465 (User Interface Design). CS465 is a course that focuses on the fundamental principles of user interface design, implementation, and evaluation. The entire class is split up into small teams to work on a semester-long project that allows students to utilize the knowledge they gained in the class. Our team consisted of six engineers, including two students from our HCI masters program. 
                </p>
                <p>After getting familiar with one another’s skills, we began brainstorming ideas. This process took over a week, and we explored many different concepts. (One of my personal favorites was an idea to redesign Reddit’s user interface and remove all usernames and badges from Reddit. This would effectively create a more focused discussion on the topic at hand, not a very personal discussion at the users associated in the post or the subreddit). After we went through everything on our idea-list, we ended up with HourGlass. 
                </p>
                <p> We originally had different intentions for Hourglass. HourGlass originally tested the idea of utilizing social therapy to help combat procrastination, but due to time and resource restrictions, we decided to focus on what mattered. The main focus of the project was to demonstrate that we, as a team, could utilize what we learned in the class, so our project focused on creating an effective visualization to represent users’ online habits in a time-centric way. 
                </p>
                <p>Hourglass helps users understand how they spend their time online in a ‘time-centric manner’. One of the biggest things that we realized early on with these visualizations of productivity is that often times people are less distracted on one single site for a continuous amount of time. Users often feel the urge to continuously check sites, but don’t stay on sites for more than a few minutes at a time. Laying out data in a Gantt Chart allowed us to measure online website visits with a time axis. On our graph, if there were entries of small yellow lines that would repeat in patterns, it would mean that the user is distracted. The way our visualization was set up also allowed users to import their google calendar through the google calendar API. This would allow users to properly understand whether they were being productive or not. No one is expected to be completely on task 24/7 of the day, and that’s something we found difficult about many existing solutions. Often times it seemed that any sort of procrastination was prohibited on other procrastination-related applications. Our visualization allows the user a comparable unit to measure against their activity. It shouldn’t be a bad thing if users are being unproductive during a non-work hour. This promotes a secondary intention that we had with this functionality, which is to help users build habits better. Taking 5 minutes breaks every hour is completely healthy, but users don’t always stick by the schedule.

            <!-- <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Hourglass was the project I worked on with my team for CS465, user interface design. Our team originally had different intentions for Hourglasss, but due to time and resource restrictions, we decided to focus on what mattered. The main focus of the project was to demonstrate that we, as a team, could utilize good design techniques that we had learned in the class.

                <h3>My role</h3>
                <p>
                    I accomplished a few things from my role in this project. First off, I was tasked with designing the main visualization page. The data is requested from our API and then visually graphed through d3. To create the three separate sections of the graph, I built three graphs in total. The first graph requests the user’s google calendar data and is located at the very top. The third day displays the user’s top 10 most visited sites in that day and plots out all the visits that the user may have in a day’s time. The second graph aggregates the user’s productive/unproductive time measurements throughout the day.

                </div>
                <p>
                    For extra credit opportunities, we had to implement a few features and functionalities. The first one was to make the entire website responsive. To accomplish this on the main visualization page, I utilized media queries and allowed the user to scroll left and right so they could still view the visualization under a smaller resolution width. Other styling changes were implemented so that the settings, home, setup, and distraction pages work under different resolutions.

                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <p>
                    The project allowed me to practice new design techniques that I recently learned, even though I did not have a big design role in the project. My role was mainly developing on the front-end side of the project since our team had prototyped a design together that we thought would fit our project well. It had been a while since I was able to focus more on design over other aspects, and I think it especially helped me gain a different perspective for the design thought process. I was able to observe how my teammates solved design issues and I was able to see things from a different point of view. It was very important for me that I took more of a observational role in terms of design for this project. It allowed me to rethink my own techniques, and I took away a lot from working with them that will allow me to further improve in my own work in the future.
                    I think, however, my biggest takeaway from this project was definitely working with a larger group to design, prototype, research, and implement an idea. I've worked on many projects in the past, but never had I planned out something in such detail. We started out by trying to figure out the problem we were trying to solve. We then conducted user studies to fully understand things that we could improve on. After reviewing all the feedback that we received, we began designing a low-fidelity prototype. We conducted user research once again and made more revisions before beginning our implementation of our functional prototype. After our functional prototype was complete, we conducted field studies and empirical studies to receive feedback, and then we made revisions to our final revised functional prototype for submission. It was a long process but I really think our prototype was solid due to all of the testing and planning that we did.

                <h3>Future Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    Though I believe we did a good job, I believe that there is still a lot of improvements that can be made. Certain parts of our design be further improved. Due to time constraints, we understood and accepted from the early stages of the project that we wouldn't be able to fully build out the prototype that we wanted and dreamt of. It is, however, a project I am still proud of, and a project that I would definitely revisit in the future.

                <p>
                    The treetabmanager is a group project that SIGCHI worked on. The treetabmanaer allowed us to track a users web browsing habits. Through further development, we realized that our visualization could provide extra information about a users productivity on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The treetabmanager keeps track of all of the web pages that a user may access or open during their browsing session on chrome. It then maps the browsing pattern in a tree. It allows the user to see “where” they originally started and how the user got to the page they wanted to.
